# 🛰️ NODE – Network On-Demand Equipment

**NODE** is a rugged, portable internet system built around the **Starlink Mini**. Designed for remote access, vanlife, off-grid fieldwork, or emergency comms, NODE combines Starlink with internal battery power and weather-sealed ports — all packed inside a hard-sided case.

## 🔧 Supported Case Builds

NODE supports two rugged case platforms, each with a custom internal layout and mounting options:

### 🛠️ Apache Build

- Case: **Apache 3800** (Harbor Freight)
- Budget-friendly layout with efficient use of space
- Ideal for weekend trips, testing, or field setups  
  ➡️ [View Apache build files →](hardware/apache-case)

### 📦 Pelican Build

- Case: **Pelican 1450**
- Clean internal layout with compact cable routing
- Designed for maximum durability in harsh conditions  
  ➡️ WORK IN PROGRESS!

## 🔋 What’s Inside

Each NODE system includes:

- **Starlink Mini dish**
- **12V LiFePO₄ battery** (20Ah recommended, though this depends on the space)
- Power switch and basic 5521 barrel jack output
- Case-integrated cable routing (no fans or active cooling)

➡️ See the [`parts-list.md`](parts-list.md) for detailed BOM and links.
